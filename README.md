## 🌐 What is CloudBypass?

CloudBypass is a private library I’ve developed over the past few months to deal with modern web protection systems — especially Cloudflare.  

It uses:
- Human-like mouse & keyboard behavior
- Smart browser fingerprinting
- Session persistence & adaptive handling
- No Puppeteer junk or 2Captcha dependency

🔒 It’s not public. It’s not on npm. It just works.

## 💼 Who is this for?

If you’re working on:
- Web scraping behind CF
- API access blocked by JS Challenges
- Automation for data research
- Anything breaking every week due to new protections…

Then this might be what you’ve been looking for.

## ⚠️ A small note

I built this for **ethical, controlled use** — like scraping your own dashboards or doing research.  
Don’t use it for shady stuff. Let’s keep it clean.

**Thanks for checking this out.** If you made it this far, I appreciate your time.  
If you’ve ever yelled at a 403 page before, trust me — I get it.
